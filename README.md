# Inventory-Project
<br>
An IoT-based Inventory Management System designed to automate and streamline the tracking, monitoring, and management of inventory using sensors, microcontrollers (like Arduino/ESP32/) and real-time data visualization through a web or mobile interface.
<br>
<h3>Features</h3>

Real-time inventory monitoring using IoT sensors (e.g., RFID, weight, ultrasonic)

Automatic stock update on item addition/removal

Alert system for low stock levels

Dashboard with analytics and inventory status

Cloud-based data logging and visualization

User authentication (optional)


<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

Hardware: ESP32 / Arduino / RFID sensors / Load cells / Ultrasonic sensors

Software: Arduino IDE / Python / C++

Cloud: Firebase / AWS IoT / Google Cloud / MQTT Broker

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or mobile app using Flutter/React Native)

Backend: Node.js / Flask / Firebase Realtime Database

<h3>##How It Works</h3>

Step 1: Sensor detects changes in inventory (e.g., item picked or placed).

Step 2: Microcontroller processes the data and sends it to the cloud.

Step 3: Cloud database updates and reflects the change on the dashboard.

Step 4: Alerts are triggered if stock falls below threshold.


<h3>Use Cases</h3>

Warehouse automation

Retail inventory tracking

Pharmacy and medical stock monitoring

Manufacturing supply chain management
